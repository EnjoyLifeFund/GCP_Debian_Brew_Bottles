You can try again using `brew postinstall perl`
==> Caveats
By default non-brewed cpan modules are installed to the Cellar. If you wish
for your modules to persist across updates we recommend using `local::lib`.

You can set that up like this:
  PERL_MM_OPT="INSTALL_BASE=$HOME/perl5" cpan local::lib
  echo 'eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

The formula built, but is not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
Could not symlink share/man/man3/BUF_MEM_grow.3ssl
Target /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/man/man3/BUF_MEM_grow.3ssl
is a symlink belonging to openssl. You can unlink it:
  brew unlink openssl

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite openssl@1.1

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite --dry-run openssl@1.1

Possible conflicting files are:
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/man/man3/BUF_MEM_grow.3ssl -> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2l/share/man/man3/BUF_MEM_grow.3ssl

==> Downloading https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert-2017-01-18.pem
==> Caveats
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/openssl@1.1/certs

and run
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@1.1/bin/c_rehash

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@1.1/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig
