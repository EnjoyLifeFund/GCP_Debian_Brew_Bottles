==> Caveats
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the SystemRoots
keychain. To add additional certificates (e.g. the certificates added in
the System keychain), place .pem files in
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/openssl/certs

and run
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash

==> Caveats
This formula installs a python2 executable to /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin.
If you wish to have this formula's python executable in your PATH then add
the following to ~/.bash_profile:
  export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"

Pip and setuptools have been installed. To update them
  pip2 install --upgrade pip setuptools

You can install Python packages with
  pip2 install <package>

They will install into the site-package directory
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python.html

Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules
this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules,
please run:
  mkdir -p /home/ralic/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /home/ralic/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
